# EngageIQ Platform Demo

This repository contains a minimal, working skeleton of the EngageIQ multi-tenant platform.
It demonstrates:

- Terraform-managed infrastructure (App Runner, Cognito, S3, DynamoDB)
- FastAPI backend with token parsing and tenant-aware routes
- GitHub Actions pipeline deploying both infrastructure and application

> **NOTE:** All resources are placeholders. Replace with real config before deploying to production.
